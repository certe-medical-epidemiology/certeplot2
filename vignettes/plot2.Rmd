# Introduction

*Plotting with `plot2()` - **Less typing, faster coding***

The `plot2()` function is a convenient wrapper around many `ggplot2` functions such as `ggplot()`, `aes()`, `geom_col()`, `facet_wrap()`, `labs()`, etc., and provides:

  * Writing as few lines of codes as possible
  * Easy plotting in three 'directions': `x` (the regular x axis), `category` (replaces 'fill' and 'colour') and `facet`
  * Automatic setting of these 'directions' based on the input data
  * Setting in-place calculations for all plotting direction and even `y`
  * Easy way for sorting data in many ways (such as on alphabet, numeric value, frequency, original data order), by setting a single argument for the 'direction': `x.sort`, `category.sort` and `facet.sort`
  * Easy limiting values, e.g. by setting `x.max_items = 5` or `category.max_items = 5`
  * Markdown support for any label, with any theme
  * An extra clean, minimalistic theme with a lot of whitespace (but without unnecessary margins) that is ideal for printing: `theme_minimal2()`
  * Some conveniences from Microsoft Excel:
    * The y axis starts at 0 if possible
    * The y scale expands at the top to be better able to interpret all data points
    * Date breaks can be written in a human-readable format (such as "d mmm yyyy")
    * Labels with data values can easily be printed and are automatically determined
  * Support for any `ggplot2` extension based on `ggplot2::fortify()`
  
The `ggplot2` package in conjunction with the `dplyr`, `forcats` and `cleaner` packages can provide above functionalities, but *the goal of the `plot2()` function is to generalise this into one function*. The default `plot2()` function currently has `r length(args)` arguments, all with a default value. 

Every `plot2` is just a `ggplot` object, and thus extendible and editable with any other `ggplot2` function, using `+` (per the `ggplot2` convention`).

### Initialisation

To start, load the package:

```{r}
library(certeplot2)
```

The `ggplot2` package must (of course) be installed, but it does not need to be loaded using `library()`. The same goes for other tidyverse packages, such as `dplyr`, `forcats` and `stringr`. They are only used internally and not required to load before using the `plot2()` function. The pipe function (`%>%`) is also being exported by this package, so it can be used by only loading this package.

# Setting plot type / geom

`plot2()` was designed to help you with creating plots by doing non-intrusive suggestions, much to the contrary of `ggplot2`, where every detail has to be defined manually.

To start with, the plot **type** will be determined automatically if left blank. For example, it will be numeric if both the x and y axes are numeric:

```{r}
data.frame(x = c(1:10),
           y = c(11:20)) %>% 
  plot2()
```

If the x axis is of class `factor` or `character`, the type will be column:

```{r}
data.frame(x = letters[1:10],
           y = c(11:20)) %>% 
  plot2()
```

Notice how the y axis starts at `y = 0` and all columns have datalabels (since the default value for the `datalabels` argument is `TRUE` for a discrete x axis) that do not interfere with plot lines.

If the y axis is absent and the x axis is numeric, the default will be a histogram:

```{r}
# rnorm() here generates a thousand random values according to a normal distribution
data.frame(x = rnorm(1000, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2()
```

If there are multiple y values for each x, the default will be a boxplot:

```{r}
data.frame(x = c("a", "a", "a", "a",
                 "b", "b", "b", "b",
                 "c", "c", "c", "c"),
           y = rnorm(12, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2()
```

The `type` arguments accepts any (abbreviation of) `ggplot2` geoms:

```{r}
data.frame(x = c("a", "a", "a", "a",
                 "b", "b", "b", "b",
                 "c", "c", "c", "c"),
           y = rnorm(12, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2(type = "violin") # can also be "v" or "geom_violin"

data.frame(x = c("a", "a", "a", "a",
                 "b", "b", "b", "b",
                 "c", "c", "c", "c"),
           y = rnorm(12, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2(type = "j") # abbreviation of "jitter"
```

# Setting the 3 plotting directions 

`plot2()` comes with three different plotting directions: `x`, `category` and `facet`. The `x` direction plots along the x axis, the `category` plots using the legend (and replaces `ggplot2`'s *colour* and *fill*), and the `facet` direction plots using facets.

In `ggplot2`, everything set in `aes()` will in fact become such a direction. `plot2()` provides no support for plotting categorically using e.g., *shape*, *linetype* or *size*.

### Tidy evaluation

All plotting directions in `plot2()` support tidy evaluation. This means that pretty much any input can be given, and `plot2()` (or actually, the `rlang` package) handles everything for you:

```{r}
#                |------> this is x
#                |    |-> this is y
mtcars %>% plot2(mpg, hp)
```

Tidy evaluation allows for in-place transformations as well:

```{r}
my_y_values <- mtcars$hp ^ 3
mtcars %>%
  plot2(x = mpg ^ 2,
        y = my_y_values)
```

## The `x` direction

The x axis is the most commonly used way to categorise values of *y* according to another variable. All arguments of `plot2()` that start with `x.` are for adjusting settings of the x axis. These are: `r paste0("'", sort(x_settings), "'", collapse = ", ")`.

### `x` labels

Many of these arguments are determined based on the input data. For example, `x.date_breaks` and `x.date_labels` are automatically determined if they are left blank:

```{r}
library(cleaner) # 'cleaner' has a rdate() function for random dates
data.frame(x = rdate(100, min = "2016-01-01", max = "2021-12-31"),
           y = rnorm(100, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2(type = "p")

data.frame(x = rdate(100, min = "2021-06-01", max = "2021-12-31"),
           y = rnorm(100, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2(type = "p")

data.frame(x = rdate(100, min = "2021-12-01", max = "2021-12-31"),
           y = rnorm(100, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2(type = "p")
```

If you have crowded x labels, it's easy to turn them:

```{r}
data.frame(x = rdate(100, min = "2021-12-01", max = "2021-12-31"),
           y = rnorm(100, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2(x.date_breaks = "1 day",
        x.date_labels = "ddd d mmm yyyy",
        type = "p",
        title = "Change this...")

data.frame(x = rdate(100, min = "2021-12-01", max = "2021-12-31"),
           y = rnorm(100, mean = 10)) %>% 
  plot2(x.date_breaks = "1 day",
        x.date_labels = "ddd d mmm yyyy",
        x.lbl_angle = 90, # <- only requires this argument
        type = "p",
        title = "... into this:")
```

These arguments automatically pop up if you press <kbd>tab</kbd> after typing `plot2(x.)`:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "347px", out.height =  "188px"}
knitr::include_graphics("x_elements.png")
```

This means that users no longer need to memorise many `ggplot2` functions *and* their arguments to actually make one tiny adjustment. So, this 'library' with all settings and options is constantly available for all who code, lowering the bar for beginners as well.

## The `category` direction

The `category` plotting direction replaces *colour* and *fill*, which were in our opinion very poorly worded (isn't fill in the plot a colour as well?). `plot2()` automatically determines the colour and fill based on the input data.

### `category` scales

The scale for the `category` is also something that can be determined automatically quite easily - it is after all based on the input data and input choices. `plot2()` determines the type of scale automatically:

```{r}
character_z <- data.frame(x = rep(letters[1:5], 10),
                          y = rnorm(50, 5),
                          # these are 5 letters:
                          z = rep(letters[6:10], 10),
                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(character_z)

numeric_z <- data.frame(x = rep(letters[1:5], 10),
                        y = rnorm(50, 5),
                        # these are 5 numbers:
                        z = rnorm(50, 5),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(numeric_z)

character_z %>% 
    plot2(x, y, z, type = "jitter",
          caption = "*category* is non-numeric based on inputdata.")

numeric_z %>%  
    plot2(x, y, z, type = "jitter",
          caption = "*category* is numeric based on inputdata.")
```

Settings to this scale can be set with arguments such as `category.labels`, `category.breaks`, `category.limits`, `category.expand` and `category.trans`.

For continuous scales, `plot2()` has an additional argument: `category.midpoint`. When using a 3-point colour scale, this the value of `y` that should have the middle colour, it defaults to the median of `y`:

```{r}
numeric_z %>%  
    plot2(x, y, z,
          type = "jitter",
          colour = c("red", "green", "blue"))
numeric_z %>%  
    plot2(x, y, z,
          type = "jitter",
          colour = c("red", "green", "blue"),
          category.midpoint = 2.5,
          category.title = "*New* midpoint!")
```

## The `facet` direction

The `facet` plotting direction splits the plot into multiple plots. Several settings are available: `r paste0("'", sort(facet_settings), "'", collapse = ", ")`.

For controlling the `y` axis, `facet.repeat_lbls_y` (defaults to `FALSE`) makes sure that all plots have the same y axis:

```{r}
admitted_patients

admitted_patients %>%
  plot2(x = age_group, y = age, facet = hospital,
        caption = "Same y axes")

admitted_patients %>%
  plot2(x = age_group, y = age, facet = hospital,
        facet.repeat_lbls_y = TRUE,
        caption = "All y axes on their own")
```

You can also omit repeated x labels as well:

```{r}
admitted_patients %>%
  plot2(x = age_group, y = age, facet = hospital,
        facet.repeat_lbls_x = FALSE)
```

Or change the number of rows the facet should be in:

```{r}
admitted_patients %>%
  plot2(x = age_group, y = age, facet = hospital,
        facet.nrow = 1)
```

No need to memorise how again the `scales`, `shrink` and `switch` arguments of the `facet_wrap()` function work!

## Setting multiple columns

For all plotting directions (`x`, `category` and `facet`), you can use multiple variables as input, for example using `c()`:

```{r}
admitted_patients %>%
  plot2(x = age_group,
        y = age,
        facet = c(gender, ward))
```

You can even use [Tidyverse selectors](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/language.html):

```{r}
library(dplyr)
admitted_patients %>%
  plot2(x = age_group,
        y = age,
        facet = where(is.character),
        sep = " -- ")
```

## Sorting

`plot2()` has a powerful sorting option for all three plotting directions: `x.sort`, `category.sort` and `facet.sort`. 

Applying one of the sorting methods will transform the values to an ordered `factor`, which will be used to orient the data. Valid options are:
  
  - `TRUE`: sort as `"asc"`
  - `FALSE`: sort according to the order in the data
  - `NULL`: do not sort/transform at all
  - `"asc"` or `"alpha"`: sort `factor`s on their levels, otherwise sort ascending on alphabet, while maintaining numbers in the text (*numeric* sort)
  - `"desc"`: sort `factor`s on their reversed levels, otherwise sort descending on alphabet, while maintaining numbers in the text (*numeric* sort)
  - `"order"` or `"inorder"`: sort as `FALSE`
  - `"freq"` or `"freq-desc"`: sort descending according to the frequencies of `y` computed by `summarise_function` (highest value first)
  - `"freq-asc"`: sort ascending according to the frequencies of `y` computed by `summarise_function` (lowest value first)
  
The default for all plotting directions is `TRUE`, except for continuous values on the `x` axis (such as dates and numbers).

```{r}
admitted_patients %>%
  plot2(hospital, y = 1, age_group,
        y.title = "count",
        stacked = TRUE,
        caption = "No sorting")

admitted_patients %>%
  plot2(hospital, y = 1, age_group,
        y.title = "count",
        stacked = TRUE,
        x.sort = "freq-asc",
        category.sort = "desc",
        caption = paste("Hospitals (*x*) now sorted on frequencies (low to high),",
                        "Age groups (*category*) now sorted on alphabet (desc)",
                        sep = "\n"))
```

The sorting can be used in combination with setting a maximum number of items to plot per plotting direction.

## Setting a maximum number of items

`plot2()` has a an option to limit data values for all three plotting directions: `x.max_items`, `category.max_items` and `facet.max_items`. They take a numeric values as input:

```{r}
admitted_patients %>%
    plot2(hospital, y = 1, type = "col")

admitted_patients %>%
    plot2(hospital, y = 1, type = "col",
          x.max_items = 3)
```

This can be combined with sorting:

```{r}
admitted_patients %>%
    plot2(hospital, y = 1, type = "col",
          x.sort = "freq-desc",
          x.max_items = 3,
          x.max_txt = "These are %n hospitals (covering %p)")
```

# Setting the values of `y`

In `ggplot2`, the values for `y` must be numeric. In `plot2()`, you can also use an in-place calculation of a (non-numeric) variable. The input will be evaluated while taking into account all plotting directions , such as `x` and `category`:

```{r}
admitted_patients %>%
    plot2(x = hospital,
          y = n_distinct(age_group),
          category = ward,
          title = "Unique available age groups per hospital")
```

# Legends

# Turning the plot with `horizontal`

* changes with `coord_flip()`
* changes theme to exchange x and y properties

# Plotting geometries (`sf` objects)

Objects of class `sf` (*simple feature*) are treated specially by the `ggplot2` package, although `plot2()` handles these objects like any other data set. Instead it returns a `ggplot` object created with `geom_sf()` internally, but most arguments are usable and even the `theme_minimal2()` theme has good use for `sf` plots.

The `netherlands` data set is such an `sf` object:

```{r}
library(sf)
print(netherlands)
```

How does it look?

```{r}
plot2(netherlands)
```
